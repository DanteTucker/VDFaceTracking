# VDFaceTracking

This is a Resonite mod, which lets the game read facial expressions and eye gaze directly from VirtualDesktop (v1.29 or newer).

This was patched together from [dfgHiatus' QuestPro4Neos mod](https://github.com/dfgHiatus/QuestPro4Neos) and [VirtualDesktop](https://www.vrdesktop.net/) VRCFT module.

To install this mod go grab the release [over here](https://github.com/Zeitheron/VDFaceTracking/releases/latest) and put it into `Resonite\rml_mods\` folder.

You are going to need [Resonite Mod Loader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader), read how to install it there.
